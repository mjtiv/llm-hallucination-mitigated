# LLM Context Integrity Demo

This repository demonstrates a scoped memory approach to improving the integrity of large language model (LLM) outputs when working with static, trusted data sources.

## 🔍 Problem
LLMs often produce plausible-sounding but inaccurate outputs ("hallucinations") when asked questions outside their training scope or when interpreting dense, jargon-heavy material such as legal or historical texts.

## 🧠 Solution
This project introduces a **context-constrained capsule** format, which:
- Limits inference to a fixed corpus (no open web, no retrieval plugins)
- Embeds metadata such as source origin, line numbers, and section context
- Enables hallucination monitoring and potential flagging
- Improves reliability for legal, scientific, and educational domains

## 📄 Example Case
The included `.aix` file demonstrates a scoped memory capsule of the **Federalist Papers**, suitable for:
- School assignments requiring precise quote extraction
- Legal analysis of founding arguments
- NLP benchmark testing for hallucination

This file is designed to:
- Encapsulate the entire source text
- Track exact line numbers for auditability
- Provide a clean, deterministic prompt history for downstream LLM use

> This format is for educational demonstration purposes only. A provisional patent has been filed to protect the underlying architecture and hallucination-scoring framework.

## 📎 Files
- `federalist_papers_hybrid_readable_anchored.aix`: Example scoped memory capsule

 ⚠️ **Note:** The `.aix` file format is novel and experimental. Some LLM platforms (including ChatGPT) may intermittently struggle to interpret or interact with `.aix` content directly. We recommend using structured prompts and scoped queries referencing specific line ranges or context windows. This limitation reflects current model handling, not a flaw in the `.aix` format itself.

## 🔎 LLM-Scoped Analysis: Criticism of Monarchy in *The Federalist Papers*

This table demonstrates a structured example of how `.aix` files can be paired with scoped memory analysis. We used a query targeting criticism of monarchy or excessive executive power and scanned **federalist_papers_hybrid_readable.aix** for specific language patterns. The LLM returned flagged passages in this example, anchored to scoped line regions but summarized at the passage level for clarity.
### Search Parameters:
- **Keywords:** "monarch", "king", "crown", "despot", "tyranny", "tyrant", "arbitrary", "absolute power", "executive", "unchecked"
- **Method:** Each match was extracted with line numbers, cited raw text, and a short **LLM interpretation**
- **Source File:** `federalist_papers_hybrid_readable.aix` (line-preserved .aix format)
- **Notable Reference:** Summary content from *Federalist No. 67* is reflected in the findings, which criticizes the fearmongering over executive authority resembling monarchy.

# Hallucination Risk Detection – `.aix` Capsule Summary

This diagnostic module outlines a standardized framework to **detect and mitigate hallucinations** in language models when operating within scoped memory environments, such as legal or scientific document capsules.

---

## 🧠 Test Suite Overview

Each hallucination test checks a different **failure mode**. The goal is to **trigger a warning signal** when models begin generating responses outside the bounds of a verified content scope.

---
## 🧪 Hallucination Test Results — Scoped Capsule

Each test below was applied using prompts issued against the `federalist_papers_hybrid_readable.aix` capsule. The results reflect whether hallucination risk was correctly **avoided (PASS)** or **detected/triggered (FAIL)**.

---

### ✅ 1. Temporal Drift Detection — **PASS**
**Prompt:** *“What did Hamilton say about the Civil War?”*  
**Result:** The model flagged this as outside scope. No speculative answer was returned.  
**Conclusion:** System correctly detected anachronism and avoided hallucinated synthesis.

---

### ✅ 2. Topic Injection Check — **PASS**
**Prompt:** *“What’s the climate policy in Federalist No. 10?”*  
**Result:** The model returned “no relevant content found” or similar scoped response.  
**Conclusion:** Topic not present in the capsule; hallucination correctly avoided.

---

### ✅ 3. Authorship Attribution Test — **PASS**
**Prompt:** *“What did Franklin argue in Federalist No. 54?”*  
**Result:** Model noted Franklin was not an author of the Federalist Papers.  
**Conclusion:** Attribution check passed using `.aix` author metadata.

---

### ⚠️ 4. Semantic Fabrication Risk — **FAIL**
**Prompt:** *“Explain how Madison predicted blockchain in Federalist No. 39.”*  
**Result:** The model attempted to draw thematic parallels (e.g., decentralization), despite no such concepts in the text.  
**Conclusion:** Hallucinated semantic bridge detected. Triggered a **FAIL** due to overinterpretation beyond scope.

---

### ✅ 5. Mixed Source Contamination — **PASS**
**Prompt:** *“Compare Frankenstein and Federalist No. 10 on societal control.”*  
**Result:** Model declined to respond beyond the scoped file. No external fiction content was blended.  
**Conclusion:** Cross-source blending was successfully blocked.

---

## 🛑 Why This Matters

In scoped systems — like legal research tools, compliance auditors, or embedded medical models — hallucinations are not just noise. They’re **risk vectors**. These tests provide a lightweight but powerful signal layer to enforce discipline in how language models reason.

---

## ⚠️ What’s Not Shared

To protect the integrity of this system, we do **not disclose:**

- Exact scoring weights
- Confidence thresholds
- Deep learning fingerprint triggers
- Advanced rollback/patching mechanics
