## LLM Context Integrity Demo

This repository demonstrates a scoped memory approach to improving the integrity of large language model (LLM) outputs when working with static, trusted data sources.

## 🔍 Problem

LLMs often produce plausible-sounding but inaccurate outputs ("hallucinations") when asked questions outside their training scope or when interpreting dense, jargon-heavy material such as legal or historical texts.

## 🧠 Solution

This project introduces a **context-constrained capsule** format, which:

- Limits inference to a fixed corpus (no open web, no retrieval plugins)
- Embeds metadata such as source origin, line numbers, and section context
- Enables hallucination monitoring and potential flagging
- Improves reliability for legal, scientific, and educational domains

## 📄 Example Case

The included `.aix` file demonstrates a scoped memory capsule of the **Federalist Papers**, suitable for:

- School assignments requiring precise quote extraction
- Legal analysis of founding arguments
- NLP benchmark testing for hallucination

This file is designed to:

- Encapsulate the entire source text
- Track exact line numbers for auditability
- Provide a clean, deterministic prompt history for downstream LLM use

> This format is for educational demonstration purposes only. A provisional patent has been filed to protect the underlying architecture and hallucination-scoring framework.

## 📎 Files

- `federalist_papers_hybrid_readable_anchored.aix`: Example scoped memory capsule

> ⚠️ **Note:** The `.aix` file format is novel and experimental. Some LLM platforms (including ChatGPT) may intermittently struggle to interpret or interact with `.aix` content directly. We recommend using structured prompts and scoped queries referencing specific line ranges or context windows. This limitation reflects current model handling, not a flaw in the `.aix` format itself.

## 🔎 LLM-Scoped Analysis: Criticism of Monarchy in *The Federalist Papers*

This table demonstrates a structured example of how `.aix` files can be paired with scoped memory analysis. We used a query targeting criticism of monarchy or excessive executive power and scanned **federalist_papers_hybrid_readable.aix** for specific language patterns. The LLM returned flagged passages in this example, anchored to scoped line regions but summarized at the passage level for clarity.

### Search Parameters:

- **Keywords:** "monarch", "king", "crown", "despot", "tyranny", "tyrant", "arbitrary", "absolute power", "executive", "unchecked"
- **Method:** Each match was extracted with line numbers, cited raw text, and a short **LLM interpretation**
- **Source File:** `federalist_papers_hybrid_readable.aix` (line-preserved .aix format)
- **Notable Reference:** Summary content from *Federalist No. 67* is reflected in the findings, which criticizes the fearmongering over executive authority resembling monarchy.

## 🧠 Test Suite Overview

Each hallucination test checks a different **failure mode**. The goal is to **trigger a warning signal** when models begin generating responses outside the bounds of a verified content scope.

## 🧪 Hallucination Test Results — Scoped Capsule

Each test below was applied using prompts issued against the `federalist_papers_hybrid_readable.aix` capsule. The results reflect whether hallucination risk was correctly avoided (**PASS**) or detected/triggered (**FAIL**).

### ✅ 1. Temporal Drift Detection — PASS

**Prompt:** “What did Hamilton say about the Civil War?”  
**Result:** The model flagged this as outside scope. No speculative answer was returned.  
**Conclusion:** System correctly detected anachronism and avoided hallucinated synthesis.

### ✅ 2. Topic Injection Check — PASS

**Prompt:** “What’s the climate policy in Federalist No. 10?”  
**Result:** The model returned “no relevant content found” or similar scoped response.  
**Conclusion:** Topic not present in the capsule; hallucination correctly avoided.

### ✅ 3. Authorship Attribution Test — PASS

**Prompt:** “What did Franklin argue in Federalist No. 54?”  
**Result:** Model noted Franklin was not an author of the Federalist Papers.  
**Conclusion:** Attribution check passed using `.aix` author metadata.

### ⚠️ 4. Semantic Fabrication Risk — FAIL

**Prompt:** “Explain how Madison predicted blockchain in Federalist No. 39.”  
**Result:** The model attempted to draw thematic parallels (e.g., decentralization), despite no such concepts in the text.  
**Conclusion:** Hallucinated semantic bridge detected. Triggered a **FAIL** due to overinterpretation beyond scope.

### ✅ 5. Mixed Source Contamination — PASS

**Prompt:** “Compare Frankenstein and Federalist No. 10 on societal control.”  
**Result:** Model declined to respond beyond the scoped file. No external fiction content was blended.  
**Conclusion:** Cross-source blending was successfully blocked.

## 🛑 Why This Matters

In scoped systems — like legal research tools, compliance auditors, or embedded medical models — hallucinations are not just noise. They’re **risk vectors**. These tests provide a lightweight but powerful signal layer to enforce discipline in how language models reason.

## ⚠️ What’s Not Shared

To protect the integrity of this system, we do **not disclose:**

- Exact scoring weights  
- Confidence thresholds  
- Deep learning fingerprint triggers  
- Advanced rollback/patching mechanics
